# Compiler Principle Lab 4 of SYSU

This is a homework project for compiler principle course of Sun Yat-sen University.

## Structure

The project contains four parts:

- ex1: **Oberon-0 programming**: Write several simple programs in Oberon-0 language
- ex2: **Lexical analysis**: Write a lexical analyzer for Oberon-0 language
- ex3: **Semantic translation with JavaCup**: Write a syntax analyzer for Oberon-0 language using JavaCup
- ex4: **Semantic translation from scratch**: Write a Predictive Recursive Descent Parser for Oberon-0 language, and plot the flow chart of the program

## Usage

The batch files in each ex folder have been designed with care. You can run them from any directory you like. Additionally for `build.bat` files, you can specify the very class you want to (re)-compile.

Here are some examples of using the batch files:

```bash
# Assume you are in the root folder of the project

# Generate lexer
ex4\generate

# Compile all the classes in ex4
ex4\build

# Run with test case in ex4\testcases\pow.obr
ex4\run .\ex4\testcases\pow.obr

# Assume you suddenly found a bug in the codes and modified Parser.java and Main.java, now you need to recompile them
ex4\build Parser Main
```
